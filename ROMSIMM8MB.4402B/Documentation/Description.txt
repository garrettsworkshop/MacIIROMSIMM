The GW4402A 64-pin ROM SIMM replaces the 
ROM SIMM of a Macintosh II-series or 
Macintosh SE/30 computer. GW4402A comes 
preprogrammed with a customized, 32-bit clean 
Macintosh ROM. The customized ROM allows your 
Macintosh to use more than 8MB of RAM, 
and also features a 7.5MB bootable ROM disk 
preloaded with System 7.1 and several utilities.


Compatibility
----------------------------------------
GW4402A is compatible with the following
Macintosh computers:
	- Macintosh IIx
	- Macintosh IIcx
	- Macintosh IIci
	- Macintosh IIfx
	- Macintosh IIsi
	- Macintosh SE/30


Fast Startup
----------------------------------------
It takes about 10 seconds to boot from 
the included ROM-based System 7.1, 
so you can begin working with programs 
or playing games almost instantly. 


ROM Disk Settings
----------------------------------------
A control panel allows your preferences
for the built-in ROM disk to be changed. 
You can boot from the ROM disk, 
mount it under another boot disk,
or hide it from the desktop completely. 
Of course, you can always hold "R" 
during startup to boot from ROM. 
It's also possible to enable RAM disk mode, 
which allows writing data to the ROM disk,
although it is not retained between restarts.
The RAM disk is enabled by holding "R" and "A" 
during startup, or by enabling a setting 
in the control panel. 


Ecologically Friendly, Gold-Plated PCB
----------------------------------------
GW4402A features a lead-free, ENIG gold-plated,
4-layer PCB and is fully EU RoHS-compliant. 
All units are tested extensively before shipment. 
Only new parts are used to build GW4402A, 
and all GW4402A ROM SIMM modules are 
manufactured in our semi-automated facility 
in Columbus, Ohio, in the United States. 


Open-Source Design
----------------------------------------
GW4402A's design is fully open-source. 
The schematics, board layouts, 
and driver software are all freely available 
for commercial and noncommercial use.
